# Project 3: Around The U.S.

This project was my first attempt at making an responsive website. Using a combination of properties such as flex blox and Grid. Instead of the briefs I was given in the first 2 sprints, I was just given a template on figma and just told to make my page look as close as possible. I essentially had to create a two different websites. One that looks good for desktop and smaller devices, ie smartphones.
